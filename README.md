# Overview
Chrome extensions allow the user to customize chrome with silly add-ons to productivity increasing ones. We’ll walk through building one that falls closer to the silly side than the productive one. Some examples include: 
* [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) helps with debugging react. 
* [Honey](https://www.joinhoney.com/) Finds you coupon codes and automatically tries them.
* [Shia Lebeouf](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/just-do-it/pdnkdpkigplndkpnciommmacnplfjbal?hl=en) -- just do it. 
* [Github Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enhanced-github/anlikcnbgdeidpacdbdljnabclhahhmd) shows each file size, link, and copy file directly. 
* [Sitemod.io](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sitemodio/efjbaneaebkanjmhengnedpllfdiocin?ref=producthunt) allows you to modify and save changes to any website you visit, with cleaner source code than you’ll find in the chrome developer tools. 

Chrome extensions can access all the API’s that a webpage might and some additional ones for interacting with chrome in ways that only extensions can. Extensions are set up much like a webpage, using js, html and css. Just like websites, extensions have a huge range of possibilities. 

A chrome extension is a simple and fun way to spruce up your browsing experience, which is where most of us spend our lives, so why not make it yours. It is also the perfect platform for some projects, the obvious ones which change how we interact with websites to entertainment ones where maybe in-browser is just the right medium. 
# Setup
## Manifest File
Create file manifest.json
Copy paste following block of quote (we can provide them a logo.png) 
Create an img folder in the root directory (where manifest.json is) and add in logo.png

```json
{
   "manifest_version": 2,
   "name": "My Cool Extension",
   "version": "0.1",
   "browser_action": {
       "default_icon": "img/logo.png"
   },
}
```


This is the initial setup for any chrome extension. In order for the logo png to show up, our extension needs to know that it’s loading those images. Add

```json
"web_accessible_resources": [
       "*.jpg",
       "*.jpeg",
       "*.png",
       "*.json",
       "*.png/",
       "*.jpg/"
     ]
```
To the json file so that all images ending with those listed would be able to show up whenever the extension uses them.

# Add Function

## Content File
The ```content.js``` file holds the actual actions of the extension: what the extension does. For this extension, we pick a random quote to display along with a picture of Tim so you can place the quote. The content file is specified in ```manifest.json``` so that the browser knows to run the script. 

Add ```content.js``` as a content script in ```manifest.json```:

```json
"content_scripts": [
    {
        "matches": [
             "<all_urls>"
        ],
        "js": ["content.js"],
    }
]
```
```content.js``` is our main js file and describes the behavior of the extension. Note that in ```“matches”``` the ```“<all_urls>”``` is a descriptor telling chrome that our extension applies to all urls and should always run. 

Now that chrome will look to run ```content.js``` we have to create it. Create ```content.js``` in root directory. Let's test it, inside ```content.js``` add an alert (or a console log);

```javascript
alert("Hello from your Chrome extension!");
```

How do we see this test? We upload our extension. 

## Testing your extension<sup id="fnl1">[1](#fn1)</sup>
Now it's time to upload our extension to chrome! Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions/)

![](img/extensionsDevMode.png)

1. Turn on *Developer mode* in the upper right hand corner. 

2. Click on *Load Unpacked* and select the directory that contains your chrome extension.

3. Make sure you turn on chrome extension. If there is an error in the code, it will give you an error message and not let you turn it on. Whenever you have an error, it is convenient to clear the error before reloading to make it clear if the error is from your newest change or just leftover.

4. <a id="refresh"></a>From now on, in order to view your edits, you have to refresh the extension on (chrome://extensions).

:white_check_mark: Check your progress out! Open a new tab and navigate to another [website](https://home.dartmouth.edu/). You're alert should popup.

## Actual Logic
We want to make our own sprite quote bot. This involves:
1. Putting an image on the screen
2. Adding quotes to it

Working in ```content.js```...

### Add an image
We have included some images in ```img/```, feel free to add your own photo or just use ```img/mohawk.jpg``` ![](img/mohawk.jpg). 

In order to add the image to the current page, we'll use some js. Take a stab at adding a div and img to the body of the html document, just like you would in a main javascript file for a normal page, like your quizz.

<details>
    <summary>Hints:</summary> 

* create a variable to store your addition
* set its inner html to be a div and image
* append it to the body of the document

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Ok, I tried. Show me the answer</summary>

```javascript
    var div = document.createElement("div");
      var imgPath = chrome.extension.getURL('img/mohawk.png');
      div.innerHTML = `
      <div id="clippy"></div>
          <img id="clippyImg" src=${imgPath}/>
      `;
      document.body.appendChild(div);
```

</details>

### Styling break
Phew, let's ditch the js for a second and make that image actually show up on the screen. Feel free to style it how you want or copy our styling.

You also have to make sure the extension knows to load the style sheet.
<details>
<summary>Where should you put this line of code: ```"css": ["style.css"]```?</summary>

In ```manifest.json``` under ```content_scripts```

```json
"content_scripts": [
        {
        "matches": [
            "<all_urls>"
        ],
        "js": ["content.js"],
        "css": ["style.css"]
        }
    ],
```
</details>


<details>
    <summary>Our Style</summary>

```css
#clippyImg{
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 0;
    right: 0;
    margin: 30px;
    background-color: blue;
    border-radius: .4em;
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px #666;
 }
 
 #speech-bubble {
    background: #00aabb;
    color: white;
    font-weight: bold;
    border-color: black;
    opacity: 0.9;
    border-radius: .4em;
    width: 150px;
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 150px;
    right: 30px;
    padding: 20px;
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px #666;
 }
 
 #speech-bubble p{
    opacity: 1;
 }
 
 #speech-bubble:after {
     content: '';
     position: absolute;
     bottom: 0;
     left: 50%;
     width: 0;
     height: 0;
     border: 20px solid transparent;
     border-top-color: #00aabb; 
     border-bottom: 0;
     border-right: 0;
     margin-left: -10px;
     margin-bottom: -20px;
 }
 ```

 </details>

Cool, you should now see the image when you open a new tab. (Remember to [refresh](#refresh) the extension.) Feel free to remove the alert at this point. 


### Add Quotes
Now, just a picture of Tim, though worth a thousand words, is worth more when it includes a pearl of wisdom he dropped in class. Fear not, we have compiled some *inspirational* quotes from class. You’ll find then in a json file called quotes. Start with loading them from the ```quotes.json``` file in ```content.js``` with the ```fetch(URL)``` method. The [fetch](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/introduction-to-fetch#fetch) method returns a promise with the requested results. Here is the example of use from google: 

```javascript
fetch('./api/some.json')
  .then(
    function(response) {
      if (response.status !== 200) {
        console.log('Looks like there was a problem. Status Code: ' +
          response.status);
        return;
      }

      // Examine the text in the response
      response.json().then(function(data) {
        console.log(data);
      });
    }
  )
  .catch(function(err) {
    console.log('Fetch Error :-S', err);
  });
``` 

Try using this method to fetch the quotes.

<details>
    <summary>Ok, so maybe you’d prefer to copy and paste…THAT’S why yOu NEED this ExTimsion. </summary>

```javascript
        // load the quotes from the json file
        const quotesURL = chrome.runtime.getURL('quotes.json');
        var quotes;
        fetch(quotesURL).then((response) => response.json())
            .then((json) => {
                quotes = json;
            })
            .catch((error) => console.log(error, error.message));
```
</details>

Alright, so you got the quotes. Now what? Let's pick one at random and update the sprite to say it at a random interval. 

Create a function to randomly pick and append a quote from the quotes passed as its argument whenever called. 

<details>
<summary>Yup, we hid this solution too. "Be the webdev!"</summary>
<details><summary>Just one more attempt?</summary>

 ```javascript
 function sayQuote(qts) {
    var quote = qts.quotes[Math.floor(Math.random() * qts.quotes.length)];
    document.getElementById("clippy").innerHTML = `<div id="speech-bubble"><p>${quote}</p></div>`;
    console.log(quote);
}
 ```
 </details>

 </details>

Where should we call this function? How about as soon as we load the quotes. 

```javascript
// load the quotes from the json file
        const quotesURL = chrome.runtime.getURL('quotes.json');
        var quotes;
        fetch(quotesURL).then((response) => response.json())
            .then((json) => {
                quotes = json;
                // say one right away
                sayQuote(quotes);
                // set an interval with some randomness to update the quote
                setInterval( () => sayQuote(quotes), 5000 + Math.random()*3000);
            })
            .catch((error) => console.log(error, error.message));
```


Here we fetch the json file, call the function immediately, and invoke the function periodically.


<!-- ## Style
```style.js``` sound familiar? If you loved CS50 you probably hate stylesheets, but maybe ENGS 12 has brought you to see the light. This file contains the css styling that you would include in any webpage. Can you figure out where to add this line of code? 

         ```"css": ["style.css"]```

(It should go in the manifest file, under content_scripts)

Now add some styling to style.css:

(Inside style.css)

```#clippyImg{
   width: 100px;
   height: 100px;
   position: fixed;
   bottom: 0;
   right: 0;
   margin: 30px;
}

#speech-bubble {
   background: #00aabb;;
   border-color: black;
   opacity: 0.9;
   border-radius: .4em;
   width: 180px;
   position: fixed;
   bottom: 150px;
   right: 100px;
   padding: 20px;
}

#speech-bubble p{
   opacity: 1;
}

#speech-bubble:after {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 50%;
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
    border: 20px solid transparent;
    border-top-color: #00aabb;
    border-bottom: 0;
    border-right: 0;
    margin-left: -10px;
    margin-bottom: -20px;
}``` -->

Alright so now you have a working chrome extension, except it is always on… And maybe at a certain point you’d rather have Shia Lebeouf yell at you than read a pearl of CS52 wisdom. 
On to making the on off button. 

# On and Off Button 
In order for a chrome extension to access browser events, like clicks, the extension needs another file, a background file that listens for events and responds to them. Since our on-off button will need to respond to clicks, we need to use a background file, as well as some in browser storage to pass the on-off state to the content script. 

## Background File 
The background file listens for browser events and acts on them. It can send information to other files via messages or set browser storage. In our case it just listens for user clicks on the extension’s button in the toolbar (top right of your browser). 

### Manifest Setup
Add the background script to ```manifest.json```
   ```
   json
   "background": {
       "scripts": ["background.js"]
     },
     
    ```

Additionally, the extension requires permission to access the current tab, the browswer storage, notification and any webpage. 
```
"permissions": [
       "tabs",
       "storage",
       "notifications",
       "http://*/",
       "https://*/"
  ]
  
```


### We are done with manifest.json.Lets work on out Background Logic.
Create a background.js file.

The first thing that our background.js file can do is set some text on the extension's logo to indicate whether it is on or off: 
```javascript
//Setting badge/button of the extension.
chrome.browserAction.setBadgeText({ text: 'OFF' });
```

Next we'll set the default state for ```enable``` to ```false``` for *off* and we'll store it in the [Chrome Storage](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/storage). ```enable``` is a boolean that keeps tracks of the on or off status of the button.

```javascript
// boolean for on/off 
var enable=false;
// store enable in local storage if you wanted to access in content.js
chrome.storage.sync.set({"enable": enable});
```

Finally, we'll want either run the content script or not run the content script based on the value of ```enable```. At the same time we have to toggle the value of ```enable```, update the text on the logo to indicate the state, and save the value of enable so that we can access it in ```content.js```. 

We use ```chrome.browserAction``` to both read events and set the badge, like above. We also use ```chrome.tabs.executeScript``` to reload the page. 

```javascript
// onclick method
chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
    enable = !enable;
    // if enabled run content.js else, reload page
    if (enable) {
        chrome.browserAction.setBadgeText({text: 'ON'});
        chrome.tabs.executeScript(null, { file: 'content.js'});
    } else {
        chrome.browserAction.setBadgeText({ text: 'OFF'});
        chrome.tabs.executeScript(tab.id, {code: 'window.location.reload();'});
    }

    // store state of button
    // with callback for debugging
    // chrome.storage.sync.set({"enable": enable}, () => console.log('Enable set to: ', enable));
    // w/o callback 
    chrome.storage.sync.set({"enable": enable});
})
```


### Incorporate the button into Content Script
Now we only want the content script to run when the extension is enabled. Since we stored the variable ```enable ``` in the browser storage when we were running```background.js``` .We access the variable and use it to dertemine if  ```content script``` should be executed.We use the [storage sync](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/storage) api to get the variable.

```javascript
chrome.storage.sync.get("enable", function(result) {
    ...
}
``` 

Since this method returns a promise, we need to put our content functionality inside of the callback. ```sayQuote()``` should be defined outside, but all of our logic with adding the image, loading the quotes, and calling for a random quote should go inside the callback and only run when ```enable == true```. Give it a go and see if it works. 

<details>
<summary>Hidden again? You've got to be kidding me...</summary>

```javascript
chrome.storage.sync.get("enable", (res) => {
    if (res.enable) {
        // add the div for the quotes and the image the page
        var div = document.createElement("div");
        var imgPath = chrome.extension.getURL("img/sunset.png");
        div.innerHTML = `<div id="clippy"></div>
                            <img id="clippyImg" src=${imgPath}/>
                        `;
        document.body.appendChild(div);
    
        // load the quotes from the json file
        const quotesURL = chrome.runtime.getURL('quotes.json');
        var quotes;
        fetch(quotesURL).then((response) => response.json())
            .then((json) => {
                quotes = json;
                // say one right away
                sayQuote(quotes);
                // set an interval with some randomness to update the quote
                setInterval( () => sayQuote(quotes), 5000 + Math.random()*3000);
            })
            .catch((error) => console.log(error, error.message));
        
        
    }    

});
```
</details>

Now your extension should only show up and display quotes when you turn it on in the toolbar! Woohoo!! 

So

Much

Motivation

# Publish
You can use the steps above to run the extension in your own browser, but actually publishing the extension takes a bit more work and $$, so we won't cover it here, but if you are interested here are the [Chrome instructions for publishing an extension](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish)



<!-- # Uploading Your Extension*
Link to Chrome Extensions
Now it's time to upload our extension to chrome!

* Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions/) and make sure *Developer mode* in the upper right hand corner is toggled on.
![](readme_images/developer-mode.png)

* Click on *Load Unpacked* and select the directory that contains your chrome extension.
![](readme_images/load_unpacked.png)

* Make sure you turn on chrome extension. If there is an error in the code, it will give you an error message and not let you turn it on.  
![](readme_images/turn_on.png)

:white_check_mark: Check-in! Navigate to another [website](https://home.dartmouth.edu/) (load a new tab) and inspect the page. In the console, your previous ```console.log``` statement should now appear!

# Summary / What you Learned

* [ ] What a Web Platform is 
* [ ] Basic understanding of Electron
* [ ] Basic understanding of Chrome Extensions 

You just learned how to make your own chrome extension! Hopefully, it was a painless experience. You can use it to create fun extensions like this or to make more powerful ones to change how you browse the web. 

Chrome extensions work similarly to websites and can access most of the APIs that a website could. Just like websites they do require a couple different files, but most of the functionality happens in one or two base js files. 


# Reflection
* [ ] How does Electron simplify the creation of a desktop app?
* [ ] What is a .crx file and when would you use it? 
1. What is a chrome extension? 
2. Why would you want to use the chrome extension platform for a project, instead of making a standalone website?

Our idea is also closely related to their idea --> we all love Tim. 

We also used the clippy extension]() to start working through building the extension and for the idea.
